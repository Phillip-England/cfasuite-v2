Okay, these x,y cords show us where to place employee signatures on the w4 and i9 documents.

These represent the top left-handed and bottom right-handed points so we can use these cords to figure out exactly where we can draw the signature on the page.

I9: (121.4, 350.4) (358.8, 363.4)
W4: (107, 681.8) (431.9, 693.5)
